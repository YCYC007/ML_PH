## Machine Learning in Public Health Final Project
1. Read in the newdata1.Rdata, the dataset was already preprocessed and can be directly read in to R. The pass need to change where you saved your data file.
2. All necessary libraries need to be installed before loaded into session.
3. The first step is to follow the code to recreate testing and training set.
4. First, follow the step and fit a logistic regression to the training set. Then use the optimal decision boundary to do the prediction.
5. Second, follow the step to do under-and-over sampling and random over sampling on the training set.
6. Third, fit RF on the original training set, under-and-over sampling training set, and random over sampling training set. (Total 4 models including LR)
7. Finally, use confusionmatrix function and ROC to show the predction results.
